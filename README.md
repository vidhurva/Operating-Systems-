A series of developed programs in relation to Operating Systems.

This respository encompasses concepts in Operating Systems.


Project 1 - pipe.cpp :
---

Throughout this project, I developed a program that allows the pipe function to read and write an interger value. This value is exchanged and forked between the parent function and the child function. Note that the sleep function is required in order for the parent and child function to take turns when exchanging values to one another.
